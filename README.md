### Links

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

There are two ways to add an image into an html,
first you can using img tag or a div with image source as a background image to it. if you're using img tag, it means the image has to be a one of the content of your website.

### Continued development

I will do more practice about layouting and using semantic html5 markup

### Useful resources
